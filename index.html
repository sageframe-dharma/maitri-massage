                      Massage therapy is a supportive tool for physical and emotional well-being. It
                      is <strong>not a substitute for medical care</strong>. I do not diagnose
                      conditions, prescribe treatment, or perform spinal/skeletal manipulations. Any
                      insight or suggestions offered are intended to support — not replace —
                      professional medical advice.</span

                      >Massage is more than physical relief — it’s an opportunity to come into
                      relationship with your body. Not just as an object to be fixed, but as a
                      living system shaped by your experiences, habits, injuries, and patterns of
                      attention.</span
                    ><span class="p"
                      >My approach is collaborative and deeply attuned to your individual needs.
                      Each session begins with conversation — not a checklist, but a chance to
                      reflect together on how you’re feeling, what your body is carrying, and how
                      you want to feel. We might explore your history of injury or activity, your
                      daily postures and movements, your energy levels, or your connection to
                      breath. All of this informs the work we do.</span
                    ><span class="p"
                      >Massage offers a unique window into the nervous system. Through skilled,
                      responsive touch, we can help the body shift out of stress or overdrive and
                      into a state of rest, repair, and integration. This parasympathetic state is
                      where healing happens — not just muscular recovery, but deeper regulation of
                      breath, digestion, sleep, and emotional resilience.</span
                    ><span class="p"
                      >My work blends therapeutic and deep tissue techniques with somatic awareness
                      and mindfulness. I may incorporate elements like guided breath, gentle
                      movement, stretching, or energetic balancing (such as Reiki) when appropriate
                      — always based on your comfort and interest. The goal is not to “fix” a part
                      of you, but to support your body’s own intelligence: to unwind tension,
                      improve circulation, and build awareness of how and why you move, hold, or
                      respond in the ways you do.</span
                    ><span class="p"
                      >Massage, in this context, becomes a practice of embodied awareness. It can
                      help you listen to your body with more clarity and compassion. Over time, this
                      kind of care supports not only physical well-being, but also greater ease,
                      presence, and self-trust.</span
                    ><span class="p"
                      >This is holistic work. It’s grounded, collaborative, and deeply personal.
                      Together, we’ll shape each session to meet you where you are — and help you
                      build a relationship with your body that is both functional and kind.</span

                      experience in therapeutic and holistic bodywork. His practice is rooted in
                      deep listening — to the body, the breath, and the often-unspoken needs beneath
                      both. Drawing on a background that bridges structural bodywork, energy
                      healing, trauma-informed care, and somatic integration, Andrew offers sessions
                      that are collaborative, grounded, and transformative.</span

                      chronic pain, trauma, disability, life transitions, and perinatal care, and he
                      regularly collaborates with doulas, biodynamic craniosacral therapists, and
                      somatic healers to provide integrated support.</span

                      meditation for over twenty years in the Iyengar and Dharma Yoga traditions,
                      practiced and lived at the Cambridge Zen Center, and brings a spirit of
